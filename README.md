Here is my portfolio demonstrating what I have learned while completing my Data Science minor at Washington and Lee Univeristy. The core competencies for this minor include 1)Collect and analyze data in a reproducible and ethically responsible manner, 2)Obtain data through searching, scraping, mining or experimental method, 3)Parse, transform and generate wide-ranging data sets for analysis, 4)Statistically analyze data to summarize, draw inferences and make predictions, 5)Identify patterns and relationships in datasets using visualization and algorithms, and 6)Communicate data methods and conclusions to diverse audiences. The projects attached are prime examples of how I have been able to build on and enhance these skills through the last four years. 

Does Having Children Affect Religiousity
I used SPSS to investigate whether mothers and/or fathers became more religious when they had a child/children. My thesis was that the GSS data will show that with more children the participant has, the stronger their religiosity will appear to be.

Speed Dating: Hobbies and Matching
This project used Qualtrics and R to see if when given a happy video (vs. sad and neutral videos) people were more likely to take risks. This study was based on past studies looking to see if mood influences risk-taking behaviors.

Risk and Happiness 
This project used R-studio to see if people having similar hobbies were more likely to match during speed dating, and found that we were able to group hobbies into a 3 factor model that includes "the arts", "sports", and "games" and participants were more likely to match with someone with similar hobbies. 



Attached are R-notebooks of the coding done in my projects along with powerpoint presentations made to explain and present my findings. 
Also attached is a reflection essay that goes into more detail regarding my portfolio projects the skills I have been able to achieve through them.
